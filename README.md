# CoviCheck

### Introduction
A computed tomography scan, or CT scan, produces detailed images of organs, bones, soft tissues, and blood vessels. In this project, I have used the CT scan lung images of covid positive patients and covid negative patients. Using this data, I have trained my CNN model and in the testing phase, we have to upload a lung ct scan image of a person, then my model predicts and gives us the result of that patient(whether he/she tested positive or negative for Covid-19).

### Purpose of the Project
This project aims to design and develop a deep learning model for early detection of the COVID-19 by using CT scan lung images.
The ﬁnal accuracy level of my deep learning model is recorded as 0.91 and the loss is recorded as 0.19.
The deep learning model answers nearly the 0.91 of the CT scan images of the patients correctly and distinguishes between the infected and not infected by the COVID-19 virus.

### Insrtructions:
  To run my code in your computer you have to need following packages Numpy, os, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCv.
  If your pc does'nt have those packages preinstalled. Follow the steps below
  1. Open the anaconda promt running as administrator.
  2. In the anaconda prompt write the following line for the packages you want.For this project tensorflow, keras, opencv, numpy, os. 
   >pip install packagename
   
  3. Now open the Anaconda Navigator nad install the jupyter notebook. Then load the saved model that i haved uploaded in the repository.
  4. For testing, follow  the testing section in the notebook that i have uploaded.
